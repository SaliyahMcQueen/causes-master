			<p>The Red Panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat with a bear-like body and thick russet fur. They were first described as belonging to the raccoon family in 1825, and this classification has been controversial ever since. The belly and limbs are black, and there are white markings on the side of the head and above its small eyes. Red Pandas are very skillful and acrobatic animals that predominantly stay in trees. Almost 50 percent of the red pandas habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas. They use their long, bushy tails for balance and to cover themselves in winter, presumably for warmth. Primarily an herbivore, the name panda is said to come from the Nepali word ponya, which means bamboo or plant eating animal.Sharing the story of red pandas with others. Simply increasing awareness about red pandas can help work towards the overall protection of these animals.Sharing the story of red pandas with others.

			<p>The South China tiger is natively found in the temperate upland forests of southern China, where its once wide range has now been reduced to a few isolated populations, which are said to be found inhabiting the mountainous borders between provinces.The South China tiger population was estimated to number 4,000 individuals in the early 1950s. In the next few decades, thousands were killed as the subspecies was hunted as a pest,also was due to habitat loss caused by deforestation. The Chinese government banned hunting in 1979.Due to the size and power of the South China tiger, it has no natural predators in its native environment. Humans that hunt the South China tiger and habitat loss are the only threats to the South China tiger. By 1996 the population was estimated to be just 30-80 individuals.Little is know about their exact numbers in the wild, but some estimates would put the number at under 20 tigers.Today the South China tiger is considered by scientists to be functionally extinct, as it has not been sighted in the wild for more than 25 years.The future does not look promising for the South China tiger and it may be the next tiger subspecies to become extinct.</p>

			<p>The Giant Panda has an insatiable appetite for bamboo.Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. These high bamboo forests are cool and wet,just as pandas like it. They may climb as high as 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.This peaceful creature with a distinctive black and white coat is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China. The rarest member of the bear family, pandas live mainly in bamboo forests high in the mountains of western China.The giant panda is listed as endangered in the World Conservation Union's (IUCN's) Red List of Threatened Species. There are about 1,600 left in the wild. More than 300 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world, mostly in China.The giant panda has lived in bamboo forests for several million years. It is a highly specialized animal, with unique adaptations.Much of what we know about pandas comes from studying these zoo animals, because their wild cousins are so rare and elusive.
